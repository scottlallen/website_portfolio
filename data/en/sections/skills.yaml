- name: SQL

- name: Data visualisation
  logo: "/images/sections/skills/microsoft_power_bi.png"
  summary: "I have trained myself to use Microsoft Power BI for data visualisation and dashboard production. While Power BI is great for fast graph production, I find R's ggplot2 package to be far more powerful. Fortunately, R is intergrated into Power BI and the two can work well together."
